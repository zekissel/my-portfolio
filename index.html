                Hello, I am a computer science student at the University of Pittsburgh, projected to graduate in December 2023.
                I started studying CS wanting to focus on game design, but after taking a few core classes I'm not sure what area I'd like to pursure.
                Currently, I'm seeking an internship in software developement or related areas for summer 2023.
                <br><br>
                Outside of class I like to play sports and videogames, hike, and hang out with friends.
                At Pitt I play goalie for the club handball team, where I am also the business manager.
            </p>
